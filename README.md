# Twitter-webpage-scrapping-for-sentiment-analysis

I did sentiment analysis for getting people's sentiment regarding house price consitions in greater Austin area of Texas. For this part, I scrapped the posts from Twitter using "#austinhousing" as my query. I limited our scrapping to 50 tweets. I mainly focused on tweeter users, data, and the actual tweet. From the actual tweets, I are supposed to get the positive or negative sentiment score, along with neutral sentiment score and a combined score.
